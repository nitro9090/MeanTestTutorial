          One of my favorite hobbies is to design and test board games.  My board game philosophy is that 
          each game needs both strategy and tactics with a controlled amount of luck (dice are only used when 
          necessary).  With that, here is a list of my current designs and a little about them.  Note, most games  
          are listed under their working title, which may be different than how I present them in other places.

             In the princely courts each player takes on the roles of an heir to the crown during the rennaissance each of which is vying to be the
             next heir.
             The easiest way to describe The Princely Courts gameplay is it is Diplomacy-light for 2-6 players.  It has similar levels of strategy, 
             bluffing, intrigue and betrayal as Diplomacy.  However, it plays in about 45 minutes, has very little player elimination (the game ends when it happens) and it wonâ€™t ruin friendships.
